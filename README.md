## Functionality
- Users can create chat rooms with an arbitrary room name
- Users can join an arbitrary chat room
- The chat room displays all users currently in the room
- A private room can be created that is password protected
- A user's message shows their username and is sent to everyone in the room
- Users can send private messages to another user in the same room
- Added a chatbot that notifys users of room events
- Added timestamps to every message
- Added options for users to select from a list of emojis to include in their messages
- All users have unique usernames (have to refresh after the error alert tho in order to re-enter a username)
- Users are alerted when errors occur (e.g. username already taken, incorrect room password, room already created, etc.)
